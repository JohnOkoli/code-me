# What is Version Control?


Version control is the practice of managing changes to software code, documents, or other digital content over time. It helps developers collaborate on projects, track changes, and maintain a record of all modifications.

# Git vs. GitHub: What's the Difference?

- Git: A free, open-source version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase over time.
- GitHub: A web-based platform that provides a centralized location for Git repositories, making it easy to share and collaborate on software projects.

# GitHub Alternatives

- GitLab: A popular alternative to GitHub, offering similar features and a free community edition.
- Bitbucket: A web-based version control repository manager that supports Git and Mercurial.
- Azure DevOps: A comprehensive development platform that includes version control, agile project planning, and continuous integration and delivery.

# Git Fetch vs. Pull: What's the Difference?

- Git Fetch: Retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository, but doesn't automatically merge them into your local branch.
- Git Pull: Retrieves the latest changes from a remote repository and automatically merges them into your local branch.

# Git Rebase: A Simple Explanation


Git Rebase is a command that replays your local commits on top of the latest changes from a remote repository. This helps to keep your commit history linear and clean.

Command: git rebase <branch-name>

# Git Cherry-Pick: A Simple Explanation


Git Cherry-Pick is a command that applies a specific commit from one branch to another branch. This is useful when you want to apply a bug fix or feature from one branch to another.

Command: git cherry-pick <commit-hash>
